# Summary

### What is "Minishell"?
It's a long project in a group of two, the goal is to create a command interpreter that mimics the behavior of bash. Minishell manages environment variables,
launches programs and handles their return. We also have a number of built-in functions, like cd, echo, env, exit, export, pwd and unset.
